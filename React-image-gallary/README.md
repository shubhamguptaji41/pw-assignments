# React Image Gallary

This is a mini project that demonstrates how to create an image gallery using React, where users can view a set of images fetched from an API and click on them to see individual image details.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-image-gallery.git

cd react-image-gallery

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Features
* The gallery displays the first 20 images fetched from the provided API.
* Each image is displayed with a thumbnail and relevant details.
* Clicking on a thumbnail redirects the user to a single image view with an enlarged image, title, and description.
* React Router Dom is used to handle navigation between the gallery and single image view.
* Error handling is implemented for cases where the server request fails or returns no images.

## Technologies USED
