A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data in a structured manner. It addresses the limitations of traditional file-based systems by providing centralized control over data, ensuring consistency, integrity, and security. DBMS streamlines data management processes, enhances data accessibility, and promotes efficiency in information handling, making it indispensable in today's data-driven world.
